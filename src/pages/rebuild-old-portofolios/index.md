title: Rebuild Old Portofolios (July 2021 2nd Week)
date: "2021-07-18"

Hi, readers. So, this note should be taken on last week but because I'm so busy lately then it takes this week to publish.
Lately, I did re-work for my last 2 portfolios of web design then I published them in Netlify. For future work, I will keep doing that for my latest web design and web dev on that serverless host because the provider support build-up from ground zero and comes with auto-deployment/continuous integration. Then, it is practical so it is easy to set up especially for a beginner like me. By the way, Netlify supports the latest tech serverless cms such as gatsby, vue-press, Hugo, Jekyll, etc.
Besides all those things, I keep doing re-learn my FE hard skill by using codewars, leetcode, and hackerrank. So that I can strengthen and keep updated on the FE's latest tech so far. Hope I can join again with some other amazing, experience and multi-talented engineer peoples
Last but not least, find my latest portfolios on these links below
