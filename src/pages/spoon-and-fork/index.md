Hello readers, on this chapter I'll be share with you about create a fork and a spoon and a plate with only HTML & CSS. It's kind of silly things to build but at least I was learn new skill about implement some  specific of common ilustration simple design into digital art.
So here it is on the below some snippet from codepen 

<iframe height="300" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="dining fork &amp; spoon css" src="https://codepen.io/e1nzb3rn/embed/MWjBvEr?default-tab=html%2Cresult" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/e1nzb3rn/pen/MWjBvEr">
    dining fork &amp; spoon css</a> by Aulia Mahardika (<a href="https://codepen.io/e1nzb3rn">@e1nzb3rn</a>)

      </iframe>
