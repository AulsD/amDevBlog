Hi readers, in this chapter I’ll be sharing with you about creating a fork and a spoon and a plate with only HTML & CSS. It’s kind of a silly thing to build but at least I was learning new skills about implementing some specific common illustration simple design into digital art. So, on below some snippet from codepen

<iframe height="300" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="dining fork &amp; spoon css" src="https://codepen.io/e1nzb3rn/embed/MWjBvEr?default-tab=html%2Cresult" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/e1nzb3rn/pen/MWjBvEr">
    dining fork &amp; spoon css</a> by Aulia Mahardika (<a href="https://codepen.io/e1nzb3rn">@e1nzb3rn</a>)
      on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
      </iframe>

Btw, those illustration design was used to be an example exercise from [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/)
If there is any critics or suggestion to improve on that digital art. I'm open to accept any comments. Thank you for reading my article. God bless you always.
