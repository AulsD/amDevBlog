##intro  

Hi Folks, How are you today? I hope that you are all okay. As the tale goes on, this article should continue from the previous topic. I'll share with you the next step after you've well known about the CSS syntax and how the CSS property can affect/implement the HTML syntax that you've been written before.

I presumed some experienced web designers/front-end dev have known about CSS preprocessor/server-side CSS rendering. Maybe all of you have been heard about BEM methodology. And BEM stands for Block Element and Methodology.

<!-- kinds of css modularity -->
Types of CSS modularity based on BEM methodology. 

1. OOCSS  
stands for an object-oriented cascading stylesheet. This type of scss modular architecture helps web designers to be easily maintained SCSS files. and as being said the object-oriented means SCSS can replicate the pattern of object-oriented in some common programming language. The concept was based on Nicole Sullivan who get an idea about the two main principles. The first was to separate the structure from the skin and the second phase was to separate the container from the content.

2. SMACSS  
was a scalable and modular architecture CSS. I guess this was the first time that I used and knew about how to organize the SCSS files per category. And then by that, we should easy maintaining the type of categories. The SMACSS(“smacks”) was dismantled into Base, Layout, Module, and State. Basically, it's kind of to be pronounced as a Style Guide rather than a rigid framework. Next, I'll share how I get used to it from this style guide and probably my genuine CSS architecture pattern for all my works as a web dev/FE engineer.

3. Atomic  
this kind of design system was being part of the BEM methodology. The methodology was created by Brad Frost. The idea was to break down the CSS file into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. All the detail that might help you to use this kind of design system was at the end of this article. I should probably make a separate article and discussion about Atomic design systems in a couple of months.

4. GPS  
was an acronym and built by an engineer employee on Hashicorp. This is a so-called CSS organization system that breaks down into three distinct levels which are Global, Pages, and Section. From my perspective as an FE dev/engineer, this type of CSS modular was might be the best and cleaner, and easier to deal with. I should take more detail into a new article with this kind of CSS modular architecture.

<!-- best practice css framework -->

All the CSS modularity pattern that I've been sharing with you was a common best practice that might be useful to you. Hope you gain some good acknowledgment from this. And thank you for reading my article. Please give a comment if any necessary words or sentences or even a whole article that feels not make sense to you.

PS: God bless you always and stay healthy.
