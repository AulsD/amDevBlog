Hi folks, this week will be discuss about user experience research or in short called UX Research. 
Me as UI UX dev Enthusiast really often curious about UX Research and all study about it. So with this article that I've been gathering from other sources hopefully might be useful for the reader. 

## Definition
As definition about UX Research it is a field study to understanding best approach of human insights and journey to meet their requirement and realistic context for a better design process. 

UX research can be various and daunting because the behaviors, motivations and needs to be generated as insight about your users. The process of UX research can be categorize as flow by including user interview, surveysm focus groupsm card sorting, usability testing, and more.

## Stages of UX Flow
The stages of UX Research could begin with qualitative measures, to determine the needs and motivation so it will be describe the purpose of the result design process meant to be. After that, by using quantitative measures to make sure the test will result in real data. 
As common best practice said, we can divide UX Research into two subsets and two approach:
- Qualitative research  
by inteviewing user and ethnographic field studies, you will get in-depth understanding of why users do what they do. Another specific of qualitative resarch is usability testing, which mean it will monitor user's stress response or user's heatmap of by visiting an example apps or websites.
- Quantitative Research  
By using more structural methods and probably using third apps party resources such google spreadsheet or microsoft excel. And so by that, you can gather measureable data about what user do and test assumptions from your qualitative research method. If the sample of your qualitative data was large enough to representation test user, you will have more in-depth statistic reliable way of assessing the users. 

And for another two approach of UX Research:
a. Behavioral  
A study about ux research that you wil listen what user need and wants.
b. Attitudinal  
A study about UX Research that you will observed through what user do.
