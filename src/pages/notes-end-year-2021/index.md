As the end of 2021 year has come, it would be nice that I should reflect on what I’ve done from the beginning of the year 2021 till the end of the year 2021.

Goals for the next year is to research and be able to keep share about my thought/opinion as FE dev UI & UX enthusiast. I would be continuing my journey story via this blog about how to develop and find purposes to achieving my career as FE/UI & UX dev.

And as the geek pc enthusiast does, On this blog probably I will share some hardware stuff that I’ve been using as an experimental test. The goal is to find high peak performance with low/middle budget.

Thank you for reading all my notes, shares and thoughts. Hope you'll get what you need and god bless you always. If any necessary recommendation thought of knowledge about tech stack escpecially FE stuff or bad grammar that you've found. Please kindly write your comment below and don't be hesitate. Your help will pay to you someday. GBU
