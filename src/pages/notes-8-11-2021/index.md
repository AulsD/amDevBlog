Hi, Morning/Afternoon/Night everyone. For the last couple of months, I've accessed an online editor website. And I'll share it with you which maybe would be the best website online editor for practicing FE(Front-End) skills especially for CSS 

There are so many websites that can improve your algorithm thinking. So far that I know, many programmers have been knowing about hackerrank, codewars, freecodecamp and so on which is they provide an online practice site for newbie or experienced developers to improve their logic skills. But, there is some site that only provides a specific skill such as CSS, which you can access for free.

This website was to be my favorite to learn CSS. The term is simple which is your code must be matched with the given result. The first time I do code and mixed match the expected result somehow I feel a little bit of lack of CSS acknowledged. The Imposter syndrome caught me in while trying to find the best CSS syntax. But after I've got matched the expected result that makes me feel want to do another CSS challenge. My verdict was about at 8.0 for this CSS online editor.
